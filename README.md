# CSharp_CompanyManagement_InterfacingCommands
A Smaller Project In Which Works Upon Our Given C# Code In Repo <a href="https://github.com/Kingerthanu/CSharp_CompanyManagement">CSharp_CompanyManagement</a> To Implement Organization Changes Through The IOrgChange Interface And It's Constituent Valid Subclasses. This Simply Allows Us To Query In Either
a Hire Operation, Team Creation Operation, Or Employee Transfer Operation. In Driver.cs We Have A Demo In Place In Which Requests A .txt Doc. While This Doc. Is Inferred To Be _demoCommands.txt, You Could Easily Swap This Or Directly Inject
Your Own .txt And It Will Work (Just The Invariants Expressed In The Demo May Be Wonk).

This Program Was Really Fun And Showed A More Realistic Application Of Our Code And Maybe How It Could Be Applied To A End-User As Giving Simple Command Access As Expressed In The Code Allows Someone of No Computer-Expertise To Know How To
Work With Our Code And Actually Apply It In Something They May Use In Their Field Of Work. This Taught Me A Lot About How To Visually Express Text In A Less Noisy Way and How To Properly Outline Our Demo Without Too Much Visual or Verbal Bloat.
While We Don't Sanitize The .txt Contents, It Further Taught Me About How Powerful Contract-Based Design Can Be As Input Sanitization Really Can Be A Drag Mainly When Reading In Lines Of A Doc.
